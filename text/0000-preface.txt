Preface
=======
Building software is a tough problem. Period. Building software across a
multitude of platforms even more so. Many programming environment come with
their own build systems which usually work out of the box and are well
integrated into the development tools. Examples of such environments are
Microsoft's Visual Studio (R), Apple's Xcode (R). If it isn't a problem to be
bound to the specific environment and plans to build the software only for the
platforms target by the development environment, they are often a good
choice for most projects.

Problems start to crop up if many different development environments and
platforms have to be supported by the same code base. Maintaining multiple
build systems in a single code base becomes a nightmare fairly quickly. It is
nearly impossible to ensure consistency across all the various build systems.
